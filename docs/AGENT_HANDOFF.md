# Agent Handoff Log

Running log of work done by developers and AI agents, newest first.

- **Read this at the start of a session** to learn what changed recently. A
  `SessionStart` hook also injects this file automatically.
- **Append a new entry before you end a session** so the next person or agent has
  context. Keep entries short: date, branch, key changes, and how to verify.
- Do **not** put exploit-level security detail here. Summarize sensitive fixes
  abstractly (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

## 2026-06-23 — branch: `chore/tests-security-image-fallbacks`

By: henry + Claude Code

**What changed**

- Added feature tests for previously untested controllers: Community, Gear,
  ProfilePost, Weather, and the API User endpoints, plus a `SecurityTest`.
- Security hardening (kept abstract): login rate limiting, a mass-assignment
  guard on the user role, removal of a TLS-verification bypass, and reduced error
  leakage on social login.
- Image fallbacks: added `public/images/placeholder.svg` and `onerror` fallbacks
  to mountain, hero, avatar, and community images across the home, explore, and
  community views.
- Removed a dead routing branch that referenced a non-existent route.

**Project state**

- Full test suite: **206 passing** (`php artisan test`).
- Environment bootstrapped: `composer install`, `npm install` + `npm run build`,
  `.env` created, MySQL databases `sumorrow` and `sumorrow_test` created and
  migrated/seeded.

**How to verify**

- `php artisan test`
- `composer run dev`, then load `/home` and `/explore` — broken image sources now
  fall back to the placeholder.

**Open / next items**

- Optional: extend the `onerror` fallback to the remaining avatar spots (feed,
  sidebar, navbar, post detail) for full coverage.
- Optional: revisit the email-verification bypass in `User::hasVerifiedEmail()`.
